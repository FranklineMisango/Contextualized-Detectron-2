Complex Dectectron2 model that can detect zones and inhibitions in a given image.
# Detection and Segmentation
 # steps to build detectron2
1) Right now it only support ubuntu and MacOS.
2) Installation:
  i) Using pip 
    python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
  ii) Using clone
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git
    python -m pip install -e detectron2
  iii) If you have cuda(GPU) :
    There are different wheel links for each torch and cuda :
    Please refer below link for same.
